I am an Associate Chief Physician in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery at The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.

My academic journey includes a PhD in Surgery from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (2015), a Master's degree in Surgery from Zhejiang University (2012), and an MD from Southern Medical University (2009).

Following my PhD, I completed my surgery residency and served as an Attending Surgeon at The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. To further my research training, I held postdoctoral research fellow positions at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (2020-2021) and Texas A&M University (2019-2020).

My research focuses on the molecular mechanisms of gastrointestinal cancers. I am the Principal Investigator for an NSFC Youth Science Foundation Project on gastric lymphoma. Additionally, I have participated in several other NSFC projects related to gastric cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

I serve on the editorial boards for several journals, including *Frontiers in Oncology* , *Frontiers in Bioinformatics* , and *PeerJ*.
